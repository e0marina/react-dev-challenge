# Form Flow for React Challenge

This is a web form created with React that allows a user to input a political candidate's information, edit it, and submit it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

After cloning the repository and installing dependencies, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Technology Used

React.js,
Bootstrap,
Formik,
Google Fonts,
Figma,
localStorage,
React Router

## Design Decisions

I based the design off of the Figma here: https://www.figma.com/proto/Nag24QhA8LMk7Pm7r8GciY/Web-Developer-s:-Project-Challen[â€¦]3A5216&starting-point-node-id=2534%3A8527&show-proto-sidebar=1

I used bootstrap so you'll notice small variations in the design because of that. I used local storage and did not build out a back end nor make this responsive for screen sizes less than lg/xl desktop width, because of time constraints that I have in my personal life (I work part time, volunteer, am interviewing elsewhere for dev work, and have a small child).

## Thoughts on Complexity

I'd say for the purpose of a rapid prototype - it was moderately complex and the true level of complexity if this were a real app would depend on additional requirements from the client (ie does any of the info need to be encrypted when storing personal data into the database).
